Since this project was created long after the lecture, many details have been lost. 
All the specific experiment requests are no longer known and some codes are missing while some 
may showed within the reports of experiments. 

NOTE THAT: A MATLAB file named as *projectA_B_C.m* is 
the source code for *the C section of experiment B in Project-A*.

This lecture experiments involves 5 projects focusing on: 
- Error analysis
- Different methods of interpolation and different interpolate node picking
- Multivariate interpolation
- Ploting using Bezier function
- Best square approximation polynomials and Legendre and Chebyshev orthogonal polynomial system
- Application of best square approximation
- Calculating integrals using Simpson and compound Simpson formula, Romberg algorithm, compound trapezoid formula and Gauss's formula
