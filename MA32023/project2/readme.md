# Description

Experiment 1: studied how different interpolate node picking (equidistant and Chebyshev nodes) would affect the results of interpolation.

Experiment 2: studied different methods of interpolation, including polynomial, linear, Hermitian and spline function interpolation. 

Experiment 3: studied the difference between linear interpolation and cubic periodic spline function interpolation for a closed graph.
