# Description

Experiment 1: Caculated best square approximation polynomial for $f(x)=e^x$ and $f(x)=|x|$. Calculate the error of best square approximation and least squares approximation for $e^x$ and $|x|$.

Experiment 2: Evaluated the error of the best square approximation using Legendre and Chebyshev orthogonal polynomial system. 

Experiment 3: Plotted a graph to fit the relationship between car braking distance and speed from the provided data. 

Experiment 4: Considered the differences between the fitted graph and the original graph when sample points are subject to positive perturbations.
