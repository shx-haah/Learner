# EM22129: Game Theory

## 2018春季	经济与管理学院

For time issue, many details have lost. This lecture is about *game theory* and I was mostly fascinated by 
a single problem: a varied version of the claasic game, *Rock, Scissors and Paper (RSP)*. So I went further 
on studying the stratagy for this game, via evolutionary view. After reading a related resource[^1], I refined my approaches
and apply it to different questions. Finally, all above together with other material from the lecture are forged into my report.
